## Prerequisites

In order to run the commands described below, you need:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- make (`sudo apt-get install make` on Ubuntu)

## Running

```bash
docker-compose build
# Repository secrets are encrypted at rest. Therefore, an encryption key is needed.
KEY=$(docker-compose run --rm dmss create-key)
echo $KEY
cp .env-template .env
echo "SECRET_KEY=$KEY" >> .env
docker-compose up
```

API documentation can be found at [http://localhost:5000/docs](http://localhost:5000/docs).

### Database

To refresh the database after first-time:

```bash
docker-compose exec dmss reset-app

```

## Available client APIs

To talk with the DMSS service, these clients are available:

- Python https://pypi.org/project/dmss-api/

## Development

### Pre-commit

The project provides a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`-file that is used to setup git _pre-commit hooks_.

Alternative pre-commit installations can be found [here](https://pre-commit.com/#install).

#### 1) Install pre-commit

Optionally create a virtualenv (recommended)

```shell script
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### 2) Install virtual environment

Virtual environment is used for running unit tests with pre-commit.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
poetry install
```

### Testing

Run BDD tests:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm dmss behave
```

Run BDD tests by regexp:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm dmss behave -n "Scenario name" # Run single test
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm dmss pytest api
```

Creating DMSS lookup with [dm-cli](https://github.com/equinor/dm-cli):

```bash
dm create-lookup dmss system/SIMOS/recipe_links
```
