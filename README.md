## Prerequisites

In order to run the commands described below, you need:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- make (`sudo apt-get install make` on Ubuntu)

## Development 

### Pre-commit

The project provides a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`-file that is used to setup git _pre-commit hooks_.

Alternative pre-commit installations can be found [here](https://pre-commit.com/#install).

#### 1) Install pre-commit

Optionally create a virtualenv (recommended)

```shell script
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### 2) Install virtual environment 

Virtual environment is used for running unit tests with pre-commit. 

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
poetry install
```

### Testing

Run BDD tests:

```
docker-compose run --rm dmss behave
```

Run BDD tests by regexp:

```
docker-compose run --rm dmss behave -n "Scenario name" # Run single test  
```

Run unit tests:

```
docker-compose run --rm dmss pytest api
```
