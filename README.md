## Development

### Prerequisites

In order to run the commands described below, you need:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Running

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

## Repository plugins
Repository plugins must be placed in the "storage/repository_plugins" directory (usually done with a docker volume mount).  
Each plugin must have a folder with at least one file: `__init__.py`  
This `__init__` file must implement a class called "Repository" that inherits from the Repository class.  

If the plugin requires any pypi-packages, add a "requirements.txt"-file generated by "pip freeze" in the
plugins root folder.

To use this repository plugin, create a repository in a data source definition, with the type matching
the plugin name (name of the folder)

Example structure:
```txt
src/
    storage/
        repository_plugins/
            my_plugin/
                __init__.py
                requirements.txt
```

## Testing

Running integration tests:

```bash
$ docker compose run --rm dmss behave
```

Run BDD tests by regexp:

```bash
$ docker compose run --rm dmss behave -n "Scenario name" # Run single test
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
$ docker compose run --rm dmss pytest
```
